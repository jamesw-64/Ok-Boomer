(You'll need to extract *all* files from the ZIP to get it to work. IDK why, that just the way it is...)

Compatability: Anything that runs Mono C# (so basically Windows, Mac and Linux)

Funny little command applet that will make your computer angery when you say 'Ok Boomer' to it!

All you need to do is open a command line and navigate to where your EXE is, and tell the computer "OkBoomer". It will get so triggered, I promise you!
